# üè† Nyumba Project ‚Äì Real Estate Data Analysis in Kenya

This projeect was initially a class exercise but i took it further and performed exploratory data extraction, manupulation and cleaning then loaded it to PostgreSQL through DBeaver. Then the  final part involved identifying trends and insights related to property prices, locations, types, and other key attributes that affect the housing market in Kenya after the data was loaded to PowerBI directly from PostgreSQL. The data was extracted from the site: (BuyrentKenya.com) and the base URL used in the project

## üìÅ Project Structure

- **Nyumba.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all data analysis steps‚Äîloading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python**
  - `pandas` ‚Äì for data manipulation
  PostgreSQL(through DBeaver)
  PowerBI  - For Data Analysis and Visualization

##  Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of Kenyan housing listings.
Remaining Parts( To-do Task)
- Exploratory data analysis covering:
  - Price distribution
  - Location-based comparisons
  - Relationship between price, number of bedrooms, and property size
  - Property type trends

## IMPORTANT AREAS TO WORK TO GAIN INSIGHTS ON:

- Heatmaps and scatterplots showing how location and house features affect price.
- Histograms and box plots displaying distribution of prices across counties or neighborhoods.
- Grouped bar plots for property types by average price or frequency.



## üìå Potential Enhancements in the future and contributions are highly welcomed in this project

- Add machine learning models to predict house prices.
- Integrate data from multiple property listing platforms.
- Develop a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash.

## üìç Context

"Nyumba" means "house" in Swahili. This project aims to empower better real estate decision-making in Kenya through data-driven insights.
